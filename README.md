# RD4-Sync

A very simple tool to synchronize the RD4-calendar (local garbage collector) with your own calendar account.

## Usage

It is currently being hosted on https://afvalkalender.rubenclaessens.nl/ and works with your postal code and house number as parameters.
You can use it by calling the following URL:

```
https://afvalkalender.rubenclaessens.nl/?postalcode=YOUR_POSTAL_CODE&housenumber=YOUR_HOUSENUMBER
```

You can add this URL to your calendar application as a subscription, which will update periodically (depending on your calendar application) with the latest garbage collection dates.
